This is a collection of scripts to allow statements to be exported from your bank account, and imported into financial management software.

It runs under your control, so you don't need to provide your password to another company.

Given the nature of this software, it's strongly suggested that you review the source before using it, and do not use it if you have any concerns.

Use at your own risk. Please be sure to take extra precautions to protect your password, especially if saving it to disk.
